abstract = {The influence of politics on economic policy is not fully understood. The challenge to ensure political inclusiveness and economic prosperity remains. Perhaps, one way to attain this objective is by increasing political competition. This paper gathers empirical evidence from Pakistan, a country with a checkered political history characterized by episodes of representative, non-representative, and indirectly elected governments. In recent years, the country has witnessed a gradual strengthening of democratic rules with economic progress. Focusing  on  nine  elections  held  over  1970  to  2015  the  authors  measure  political  competition and estimate its impact on economic policy. Contrary to popular conceptions about Pakistan’s economy, they find a positive association between lack of political competition and poor economic policy. This finding holds at national as well as subnational levels in Pakistan and withstands a number of robustness tests.}

abstract = {This paper examines the effects of state-level adult and child seasonal flu vaccination rates on hourly real wages for women. Using an IV method to address possible endogeneity, we find a significantly positive effect of adult vaccination on women’s wages. Furthermore, we show that this effect is stronger for working mothers age groups 16-24 and 25-44, and those with younger children aged 6 months-12 years. We also find that children’s vaccination has a significantly positive effect on mothers’ wages and that this effect is stronger for women with younger children. The results also show that the positive effect is particularly larger for non-college educated women, aged 16-44 with at least one child. These effects are also stronger for mothers with younger children.}

abstract = {I explore the effect of the incumbent political ideology on opting into an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan program and conditions and, in turn, the effect of an IMF loan and conditions imposed on political ideology and government change. The literature on foreign aid and loans highlights that during the periods in which countries are closer in terms of the political ideology of incumbent parties, they are more likely to give and receive foreign aid and loans to each other. A similar political ideology fosters trust and decreases the transaction costs of foreign aid and loans. But does this relationship hold for multilateral institutions like the IMF? The IMF closely follows the neoclassical school of economic thinking, which strongly advocates for free and competitive markets to foster economic growth instead of state interventionism or state-initiated development policy. No previous study has focused on the relationship between partisan preferences, IMF programs, and loan conditionalities. The empirical analysis takes the endogeneity of IMF program and conditions into account. The results show that left-wing governments are less likely to opt into an IMF program than right-wing governments. Conditional on signing an IMF deal, countries are more likely to go through an ideology shift toward right-wing. However, left-wing governments face fewer number of IMF conditions compared to the right-wing governments.}

abstract = {How do campaign contribution laws affect pro-welfare policies? The US political system is highly unequal as policy preferences of high-income citizens are often prioritized compared to that of low-income groups. Therefore, it is widely believed that interest groups -- corporations, PACs, and labor unions -- employ campaign contributions as a bargaining tool to obtain access, favor, or vote by political candidates. Evidence shows that restricting money in politics via stricter campaign contribution laws can reduce the bargaining power of interest groups over candidates and increase the say of low-income groups in policy matters. Therefore, the effect of stricter contribution laws should also manifest as a shift towards relatively pro-welfare policies. This paper analyzes the relationship between stricter campaign contribution laws and pro-welfare policy across the state-wide legislative races from 1980 to 2018, exploiting the heterogeneity of laws across the US states. The legislative power of state representatives on minimum wage and earned income tax credit policies makes them a good proxy of a state's welfare policy; alternative welfare policy proxies are also employed. The empirical results from the two-way fixed-effects model and the interactive fixed-effects counterfactual estimator indicate that stricter campaign contribution laws lead to higher minimum wage at the state level. Not as strong, but the estimates also suggest that more stringent contribution laws in a state result in a relatively generous EITC rate as a percentage of the federal rate. The effect of stricter laws on welfare policy generosity is also evident when alternative state welfare policy proxies are used. The empirical estimates withstand a variety of robustness tests.}
