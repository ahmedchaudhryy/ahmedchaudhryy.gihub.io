Hi, welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. Economics candidate at the University of Oklahoma, expecting to graduate in May 2024. I work on applied micro and macro issues focusing on political economy and development. 

My Ph.D. dissertation includes three essays: the effect of US state-level campaign contribution laws on welfare policy, the relationship between political ideology and productive capabilities (long-run development), and how political ideology affects IMF program participation and vice versa.
In my free time, I like to read, play Xbox, or make travel plans with my family.
