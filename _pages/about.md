Hi, welcome to my website! <br />
<br>

I am a Ph.D. Economics candidate at the University of Oklahoma (OU), expecting to graduate in May 2024. I work on applied micro and macro issues focusing on political economy, development, and public economics. <br /> 
<br>

My Ph.D. dissertation includes three essays: the effect of US state-level campaign contribution laws on welfare policy, the relationship between political ideology and productive capabilities (long-run development), and how political ideology affects IMF program participation and conditionalities and how IMF program and conditions, in turn, affect political ideology. <br />  
<br> 

I have also taught three courses (seven times) at OU as a principal instructor. These include Principles of Microeconomics (twice), Principles of Macroeconomics (four times), and Intermediate Microeconomic Theory (once). I also have two years of experience as a teaching assistant.

<br>

I am available for interviews in the 2023-24 job market. <br /> 
<br>

In my free time, I like to read, play Xbox, or make travel plans with my family.  <br />
